# LOUD
This is for the creation of to-be established brand LOUD website.
This repository will contain all files and referenced files pertaining to the creation of the website.
Associated languages that will be worked in: HTML, CSS and Javascript
So far I have utilised html, css and the content creation assistance of Bootstrap 5.
Updates for buttons and operations will be adjusted when I learn the necessary Javascript for them.
Custom stylings of adjustional pages are currently inspired by the pages of clothing brands Jadedldn and Nakedwolfe
